    "**Background**: Bioprinting uses additive manufacturing to create three-dimensional structures containing living cells, enabling controlled in vitro experiments that better mimic the tumour microenvironment. Certain printing parameters, such as extrusion pressure and nozzle diameter, can substantially reduce post-printing cell viability. Recent work has shown that supervised machine learning models can predict printing outcomes, including cell viability, from printer and bioink parameters. In *Machine Assisted Experimentation of Extrusion-Based Bioprinting Systems*, Tian et al. compiled a multi-laboratory dataset of 617 cell viability measurements and applied several ML models to predict printing outcomes."

    "\n",
    "Accuracy alone can be misleading when one class appears infrequently. For example, for a dataset where class A appears 1% of the time, we can apply a model that predicts class B 100% of the time. This would result in an accuracy of 100%, but of course this model is effectively useless. This is why precision and recall are important metrics to use as they tell you about false positives and false negatives. For example, a model may want to avoid false negatives as much as possible, like in bank fraud prediction, as the consequence of a false negative is extremely dire."
